# COMP.SE.200-2022-2023-1 testing project

## Purpose of this repository

This is a testing project of a library (https://github.com/otula/COMP.SE.200-2022-2023-1) for the Software Testing course at Tampere University.

The repository contains the source code that is under testing and the test folder which contains the tests implemented by us.

Removing this license file directly violates terms and conditions of the software under testing.
Individuals who remove or modify the license file will also carry the consequences.
